<!-- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->
ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Post-doctoral Researcher at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am interested in undersanding how deep learning models are optimized and how they learn knowledge and do reasoning. In next at least one year, I will delve into studying LLM reasoning mechanisms, agent workflow, fast finetuning and inference, and some practical LLMsâ€™ applications. ðŸ’¬ Welcome for any discussions about ML, LLM, ML system, and anything related.

I'm maintaining some useful paper reading lists for deep learning and LLM ðŸ¤”.
